      <header>Space Ducks: The great escape</header>
      <text>Complete challenging Sokoban-like puzzles, by moving the space ducks in the right sequence, in order to reach the power source their ship requires and travel to the next level. But tread lightly, as walking on loose ground will propel into space what ever is standing on the other side. One duck's progress could mean another duck's demise! And even if a duck goes solo (years of living on precarious planets have turned the ducks into a somewhat callous people), remember that their is no escaping gravity and that one false move could bring it's mission to a crashing conclusion.</text>
